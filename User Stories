User Stories: !.Answer Checker: User inputs math problems → program checks correctness. Adaptation: program can generate random math problems instead of relying on parent input. 
2. Memory Bank: Original: parent stored problems for child to solve later. Adaptation: program generates and stores problems for recall/redo. 
3. Number Guesser: Game mode where user tries to guess a secret number with feedback. user selects a random secret number so that the user can play a game with feedback the user guesses numbers, 
program picksapart the question so that the user solves not just for the answer,but ensures thatkey also understand the question as a whole.

Summary of What the Program Does: In the beginning Starts with a main menu (4 choices).

Answer Checker (choice 1) lets the user: Pick an operation (+, -, *, /). Enter numbers. Try to solve the problem.Get feedback if correct or not.

Memory Bank (choice 2) → Not built yet (just prints "DEBUG: 2"). Memory Bank will store problems automatically + allow playback (user can solve stored problems later).

Number Guesser (choice 3) → Not built yet (just prints "DEBUG: 3"). Number Guesser game will – random secret number, user guesses with feedback, game ends when guessed, attempts displayed.

Exit (choice 4) → Ends the program.
