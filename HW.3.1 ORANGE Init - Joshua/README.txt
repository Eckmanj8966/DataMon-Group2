How to install dependencies:
- I had to use Visual Studio Code to get mine to run.
- You will have to pip install python and streamlit
- Also the creation of a virtual environment named "venv" with the app.py file within.

How to run the application:
- Open the command prompt in VSC and set use the command "cd venv"
- After doing that type "python -m streamlit run app.py" to run the code.

What it does:
It will prompt the user for a math equation than ask for the answer. Then the app will tell the user if the answer was correct or not.

Known limitations:
As of my testing, there is nothing I can think of.
